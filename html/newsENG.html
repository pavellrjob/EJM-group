                        <h3>1. Strength</h3>
                        <p>Adhesion and compressive strength are important properties in almost all repair and protection work.<br><br>
                            
                        The strength of the base material and the repair materials should be approximately the same.<br><br>
                        
                        However, if the strength of both the base and repair materials are high,the repair material would fail prematurely due to an uneven flow of stress and strain.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="durability-text">
                        <h3>2. Durability</h3>
                        <p>The repair material must be durable under the exposure conditions to which the defective structure will be exposed.<br><br>

                        It should have sufficient resistance to chemical attack and resistance to any form of energy such as UV rays  and heat</p>

                        <h3>3. Coefficient of thermal expansion</h3>
                        <p>The repair material must have a coefficient of thermal expansion thatis almost exactly that of the old concrete. Make sure that no inadmissible loads are transferred to the adhesive bond or the substrate.<br><br>
                           
                        Thermal incompatibility can lead to failure either at the interface or within the lower strength material (especially coatings).</p>

                    <div class="second-r_right">
                        <h3>4. Permeability</h3>
                        <p>The permeability of the repair materials should be low in order to prevent the penetration of aggressive substances such as carbon dioxide, water, oxygen, industrial gases and vapors. This serves to protect the reinforcement from corrosion.</p>

                        <h3>5. Good manufacturability</h3>
                        <p>For an effective and sustainable repair, the processability of the repair materials should be good. In order to achieve good workability,an additive should be added to the repair material.<br><br>

                        When the workability of repair material is very poor, the material is not easy to apply. Therefore, the workability also influences the selectionof the repair material for building maintenance.</p>

                    <div class="third-r_right">
                        <h3>6. Stability</h3>
                        <p>We recognize some of the greatest challenges facing society and our planet. Repair materials should not be harmful to craftsmen or the environment.<br><br>
                            
                        Not only by recycling the packaging or not printing the documents, but also by the production methods and functionality that are used.</p>

                        <h3>7. Color and texture properties</h3>
                        <p>When repairing exposed concrete surfaces, the color and structure of the repair material must not deviate significantly from the adjacent surface.<br><br>
                            
                        Tests can be carried out on site before the actual repair work begins.</p>

                    <div class="forth-r_right">
                        <h3>8. Cost</h3>
                        <p>The cost of the repair supplies affects the cost of the entire repair program. Do not buy the cheapest repair material, first check that the repair material is durable or do not buy any material.<br><br>

                        Cost is a major factor when choosing a repair material. And it affects all types of work.</p>
